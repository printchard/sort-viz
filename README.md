## What is it?

Sort-Viz is a sorting algorithm visulization project done for fun. It is done in the C language using [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) as its engine for the visualization.

## How to run it?

You should be able to run the project by downloading the [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library and compiling its source code to your arch, and then linking that library to the binary created by compiling the files in `src/`.
